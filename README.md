NumberCaptcha
=============

A Captcha Vaadin Component implemented in JavaScript
----------------------------------------------------

This is a skeleton project that is pretty much the minimum of what needs to be done to have a Shared State to be used from the Vaadin Component that represents the widget rendered on the client side in the browser, and the client-to-server RPC.
